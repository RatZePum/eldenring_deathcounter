TESSERACT MODES
example custom conf: --psm 13 --oem 2

Page segmentation modes (PSM) | --psm:
    0 Orientation and script detection (OSD) only.
    1 Automatic page segmentation with OSD.
    2 Automatic page segmentation, but no OSD, or OCR. (not implemented)
    3 Fully automatic page segmentation, but no OSD. (Default)
    4 Assume a single column of text of variable sizes.
    5 Assume a single uniform block of vertically aligned text.
    6 Assume a single uniform block of text.
    7 Treat the image as a single text line.
    8 Treat the image as a single word.
    9 Treat the image as a single word in a circle.
    10 Treat the image as a single character.
    11 Sparse text. Find as much text as possible in no particular order.
    12 Sparse text with OSD.
    13 Raw line. Treat the image as a single text line, bypassing hacks that are Tesseract-specific.

OCR Engine modes (OEM | --oem):
    0 Legacy engine only.
    1 Neural nets LSTM engine only.
    2 Legacy + LSTM engines.
    3 Default, based on what is available.


The crop have to be with a border of a view px like 20+
without a border the image recognition fails nearly every time

now i use >> [480:600, 300: 1600] <<

before there was no border on top or bottom [515:575, ...]
=> no recognition happened


full crop and masking works fine with default settings
normal crop without masking needs psm 13 owm 2
