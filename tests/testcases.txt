Every testcase should be repeated at least 10 times in distinct areas of an
defined location.
That means:
    i pick a location on the map of a specific color pallet and
    casually running around and trying to die via falling, fighting or
    dying mechanism.

# EXAMPLE AREAS
- limgrave overworld (greeny - bluey - yellow)
- normal caves (grey)
- dark caves like the poison area (grey - black)

# TRY TO FCK THE SYSTEM - trying to die with red in the image
- blood area (red)
- ant caves (red + black)
- blood caves (red + black)
